# This version includes many breaking changes and a full internal rewrite.

* **Patron's name on NPM has changed!** We were able to get the `patron` module on NPM, which we will release all future versions of patron to.
* **Patron is now licensed under GPL-3 or later.** This is a far more lax license that should allow more freedom to patron users.
* **Patron now automatically detects the Discord API library being used** via a pre-install script. Using multiple libraries at once isn't supported, and the library must be installed first. TypeScript/VSCode users who wish to switch to a different library will want to reinstall patron afterwards to update the typings.
* **Patron supports ECMAScript modules.** You can access this by `import`ing `"patron/esm"` (or just `"patron"` in Node.js 13.7.0+) in ECMAScript modules. Patron still maintains full support of CommonJS modules.
* **Patron has full TypeScript support.** Although patron had typings already, they were untested and poorly written. The typings are now highly tested and have been checked over by several TypeScript developers (Thank you [George](https://github.com/Geo1088), [Apacheli](https://github.com/Apacheli) and [Skillz4Killz](https://github.com/Skillz4Killz)).

## List of all changes:

* Renamed `CommandError` to `ResultType`:
  * Renamed `BotPermission` to `ClientPermission`.
  * Renamed `Command` to `Execution`.
  * Renamed `Exception` to `Error`.
  * Renamed `InvalidArgCount` to `ArgumentCount`.
  * Renamed `InvalidContext` to `Context`.
  * Renamed `UnknownCmd` to `Unknown`.
* Added `ResultType.Success`, which replaces `Result.success`.
* Added `ResultType.ArgumentOrder`, which indicates out-of-order chained optional Arguments.
* Changed several default TypeReaders:
  * `BooleanReader` accepts more inputs, including `"on"` and `"off"`.
  * `ColorReader` only accepts hex colors.
  * `IntegerReader` doesn't accept unsafe integers.
  * `TimeReader`:
    * Doesn't accept excessively large or negative numbers.
    * No longer considers centuries or decades valid units of time.
    * Will parse valid unit names without any number as one of that unit.
  * Removed all Channel-related readers except for `GuildChannelReader`.
  * Renamed `GuildChannelReader` to `ChannelReader`.
  * Removed `GuildEmojiReader`, equivalent behavior can be achieved with a `Precondition` and the `EmojiReader`.
* Changed `Result`:
  * Removed `Result.errorReason`.
  * Removed `Result.commandName`.
  * Removed `Result.success` (see `ResultType.Success`).
  * Renamed `Result.commandError` to `Result.type`.
* Removed `ArgumentResult`.
* `CommandResult` now handles unknown commands, invalid argument counts, and out-of-order arguments.
* `ExecutionResult` now handles the original functionality of the `CommandResult` class.
  * Added `ExecutionResult.fromSuccess()`, which provides a value to `Postcondition`s without reverting `Cooldown`s like `fromFailure()` does.
* Added `CooldownResult.group`, which is the `Group` the cooldown was on if relevant.
* Renamed `ExceptionResult` to `ErrorResult`.
* Renamed `InvalidContextResult` to `ContextResult`.
* Removed `description` from every structure except for `Command` and `Group`, it now defaults to `undefined`.
* Changed `Argument`:
  * Changed `name` and `key` to default to the value of `type`.
  * Added `typeOptions` which provides custom options to the `TypeReader`.
  * Significantly improved the functionality of `optional` arguments.
* `ArgumentPrecondition` and `Precondition` no longer require `run()` to return a `Promise`.
* The `value`/`input` parameters of `ArgumentPrecondition.run()`/`TypeReader.read()` are now first.
* Added `Command.setDefaults()` and `Group.setDefaults()` methods which set default options for the structures.
* Changed `Command`:
  * `arguments` accepts `ArgumentOptions` as well as `Argument`s.
  * Renamed `botPermissions` to `clientPermissions`.
  * Changed `group` to be optional.
  * Removed `hasCooldown`, check if `cooldowns` is defined instead.
  * `getExample()` and `getUsage()` have an optional prefix parameter.
  * `getExample()` returns undefined if any `Argument` examples are missing.
* Changed `Group`:
  * Added `cooldowns`, which will be run on every `Command` in the group.
  * Removed `commands`, use `Registry.getGroupedCommands()` instead.
* Added `Cooldown.aggressive`, when enabled the cooldown will be set back to the full duration every time it's used past the limit.
* Changed `Postcondition.run()`'s second parameter from a result to a value provided by an `ExecutionResult`.
* Changed `Registry`:
  * Stores all structures in `Map`s instead of `Array`s.
  * Added `get()` methods for all structures (eg `getCommand()`).
  * Added `registerPrefixes()` and `unregisterPrefixes()` for full prefix support.
* Changed `Handler`:
  * Undocumented all methods except for `run()`, other methods have no guarantees.
  * Removed the `prefixLength` parameter from `run()` (see `Registry.registerPrefixes()`).
  * Added `executeCommand()` for manual execution of `Command`s.
* Changed `Mutex` to use `lock()` and `unlock()` instead of `sync()`.
* Removed `MultiMutex` from exports, use cases were too rare and identical functionality can be achieved with `Mutex`.
