# This version includes many breaking changes and a full internal rewrite.

* **Patron's name on NPM has changed!** We were able to get the `patron` module on NPM, all future versions of patron will be released on it.
* **Patron is now licensed under LGPL-3.0 or later.** This is a far more lax license that should allow more freedom to patron users.
* **Patron supports ECMAScript modules.** You can simply use `import` in any ECMAScript modules (includes named exports). Patron still maintains full support of CommonJS modules.
* **Patron has full TypeScript support.** Although patron had typings already, they were untested and poorly written. The typings are now highly tested and have been checked over by several TypeScript developers (Thank you [George](https://github.com/Geo1088), [Apacheli](https://github.com/Apacheli) and [Skillz4Killz](https://github.com/Skillz4Killz)).

## List of all changes:

* Changed all enums to use Numbers instead of Symbols. This was done to improve TypeScript support.
* Renamed `CommandError` to `ResultType`:
  * Renamed `BotPermission` to `ClientPermission`.
  * Renamed `Command` to `Execution`.
  * Renamed `Exception` to `Error`.
  * Renamed `InvalidArgCount` to `ArgumentCount`.
  * Renamed `InvalidContext` to `Context`.
  * Renamed `UnknownCmd` to `Unknown`.
* Added `ResultType.Success`, which replaces `Result.success`.
* Added `ResultType.ArgumentOrder`, which indicates out-of-order chained optional Arguments.
* Changed several default TypeReaders:
  * `BooleanReader` accepts more inputs, including `"on"` and `"off"`.
  * `ColorReader` only accepts hex colors.
  * `IntegerReader` doesn't accept unsafe integers.
  * `TimeReader`:
    * Doesn't accept excessively large or negative numbers.
    * No longer considers centuries or decades valid units of time.
    * Will parse valid unit names without any number as one of that unit.
  * Removed all Channel-related readers except for `GuildChannelReader`.
  * Renamed `GuildChannelReader` to `ChannelReader`.
  * Removed `GuildEmojiReader`, equivalent behavior can be achieved with a `Precondition` and the `EmojiReader`.
* Changed `Result`:
  * Removed `Result.errorReason`.
  * Removed `Result.commandName`.
  * Removed `Result.success` (see `ResultType.Success`).
  * Renamed `Result.commandError` to `Result.type`.
* Removed `ArgumentResult`.
* `CommandResult` now handles unknown commands, invalid argument counts, and out-of-order arguments.
* `ExecutionResult` now handles the original functionality of the `CommandResult` class.
  * Added `ExecutionResult.fromSuccess()`, which provides a value to `Postcondition`s without reverting `Cooldown`s like `fromFailure()` does.
* Added `CooldownResult.group`, which will be `true` if the Cooldowns were on a Group and not a Command.
* Renamed `ExceptionResult` to `ErrorResult`.
* Renamed `InvalidContextResult` to `ContextResult`.
* Removed `description` from every structure except for `Command` and `Group`, it now defaults to `undefined`.
* Changed `Argument`:
  * Changed `name` and `key` to default to the value of `type`.
  * Added `typeOptions` which provides custom options to the `TypeReader`.
  * Significantly improved the functionality of `optional` arguments.
* `ArgumentPrecondition` and `Precondition` no longer require `run()` to return a `Promise`.
* The `value`/`input` parameters of `ArgumentPrecondition.run()`/`TypeReader.read()` are now first.
* Added `Command.setDefaults()` and `Group.setDefaults()` methods which set default options for the structures.
* Changed `Command`:
  * `arguments` accepts `ArgumentOptions` as well as `Argument`s.
  * Renamed `botPermissions` to `clientPermissions`.
  * Changed `group` to be optional.
  * Removed `hasCooldown`, check if `cooldowns` is defined instead.
  * Changed `cooldowns` to be an array instead of a single cooldown.
  * `getExample()` and `getUsage()` have an optional prefix parameter.
  * `getExample()` returns undefined if any `Argument` examples are missing.
  * Renamed all cooldown methods (e.g. `useCooldown`) to have plural names.
* Changed `Group`:
  * Added `cooldowns`, which will be an array of Cooldowns to run on every `Command` in the group.
  * Added cooldown methods which are identical to the ones `Command`s have.
  * Removed `commands`, use `Registry.getGroupedCommands()` instead.
* Changed `Cooldown`:
  * Added `aggressive`, when enabled the cooldown will be set back to the full duration every time it's used past the limit.
  * Changed `sorter`, now async functions can be provided and a Message object is supplied instead of user and guild IDs.
  * Added `failure`, which indicates that a Cooldown should be applied to failed Command executions only.
* Changed `Postcondition.run()`'s second parameter from a result to a value provided by an `ExecutionResult`, and added a `Command` parameter at the start.
* Changed `Registry`:
  * Stores all structures in `Map`s instead of `Array`s.
  * Added `get()` methods for all structures (eg `getCommand()`).
  * Added `registerPrefixes()` and `unregisterPrefixes()` for full prefix support. Global prefixes will apply to DMs and all guilds with no guild-specific prefixes.
* Changed `Handler`:
  * Undocumented all methods except for `run()` and `runPreconditions()`, other methods have no guarantees.
  * Removed the `prefixLength` parameter from `run()` (see `Registry.registerPrefixes()`).
  * Added `executeCommand()` for manual execution of `Command`s.
  * Added `parsePrefix()` for determining which prefix a message has.
* Changed `Mutex` to use `lock()` and `unlock()` instead of `sync()`.
* Removed `MultiMutex` from exports, use cases were too rare and identical functionality can be achieved with `Mutex`.
* Added `ImportAll`, which will replace `RequireAll` when the library is used in an ECMAScript module.
