## About
**Patron** is an efficient and maintainable command framework for [discord.js](https://github.com/hydrabolt/discord.js) and [Eris](https://github.com/abalabahaha/eris) that aims for true flexibility. Patron doesn't have a modified client, manage the message event for you, or clutter other libraries with extensions. Patron has full support for TypeScript, as well as ECMAScript modules.

## Should I use Patron?
Patron isn't designed for beginners, but for those who want a highly flexible framework and fast development time. Bots with complex or many features will see higher maintainability and reusable code.

## Installation
Patron expects Eris or discord.js to be installed separately beforehand, in order to support both this is necessary. You'll need to reinstall patron if you want to switch between the two, as using both libraries at once isn't supported. You can install everything in a single command using the right order, for example:
```bash
npm i --no-optional eris patron # remove --no-optional for voice
```

## Documentation
Patron's documentation has a complete API reference, as well as a guide explaining basic use of every feature with examples.
